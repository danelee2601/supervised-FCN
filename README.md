# Description
Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) was proposed in a paper [1]. FCN's architecture is shown in the figure below. \
![Architecture of FCN](.imgs/fcn.png)

This repository offers a supervised-training code of FCN on all the subset datasets of the UCR archive. 
The trained FCN will be used to compute the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) score for evaluation of generated time series.

# Training History
The training histories of FCN on all the UCR subset datasets are available [here](https://wandb.ai/daesoolee/supervised-FCN?workspace=user-daesoolee).

A training and test dataset split is the same as provided in the UCR archive, and a test dataset is used as a validation set during training for better training progress tracking.
