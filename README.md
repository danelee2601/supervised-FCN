# Description
Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) was proposed in a paper [1]. FCN's architecture is shown in the figure below. \
![Architecture of FCN](.imgs/fcn.png)

This repository offers a supervised-training code of FCN on all the subset datasets of the UCR archive. 
The trained FCN will be used to compute the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) score for evaluation of generated time series.

# `pip` installation
```angular2html
pip install supervised-fcn
```

# Load a Pretrained FCN 
```angular2html
from supervised_FCN.example_pretrained_model_loading import load_pretrained_FCN

subset_dataset_name = ...  # 'Adiac'
fcn = load_pretrained_FCN(subset_dataset_name)
fcn.eval()
```
You can do the **_forward propagation_** as follows:
```angular2html
x = torch.rand((1, 1, 176))  # (batch_size, in_channels, length)
out = fcn(x)  # (batch_size, n_classes); an output right before the softmax layer.
```
You can obtain the _**representation (feature) vector**_ (_i.e.,_ a vector right after the last pooling layer) as follows:
```angular2html
x = torch.rand((1, 1, 176))  # (batch_size, in_channels, length)
z = fcn(x, return_feature_vector=True)  # (batch_size, feature_dim)
```

# Compute FID and IS
### FID
```angular2html
from supervised_FCN.example_compute_FID import calculate_fid

x_real = torch.rand((1, 1, 176))  # (batch_size, in_channels, length)
x_fake = torch.rand((1, 1, 176))  # (batch_size, in_channels, length)

z_real = fcn(x_real, return_feature_vector=True)  # (batch_size, feature_dim)
z_fake = fcn(x_fake, return_feature_vector=True)  # (batch_size, feature_dim)

fid_score = calculate_fid(z_real.cpu().detach().numpy(), z_fake.cpu().detach().numpy())
```

### IS
```angular2html
from supervised_FCN.example_compute_IS import calculate_inception_score

x = torch.rand((1, 1, 176))  # (batch_size, in_channels, length)
out = fcn(x)  # (batch_size, n_classes); an output right before the softmax layer.
p_yx = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out, dim=-1)  # p(y|x); (batch_size, n_classes)

IS_mean, IS_std = calculate_inception_score(p_yx.cpu().detach().numpy())
```

# Training

## Prerequisite for Training
You need to download the UCR archive dataset and put it in `supervised_FCN/datasets/`. You can download it from [here](https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/daesool_ntnu_no/EUVHWAlJRrZBnCZMAOdTR-cB3m_LP7Q10Y78meuzUAuIBQ?e=h9aGhi).
Then, your `supervised_FCN/datasets` directory should have `supervised_FCN/datasets/UCRArchive_2018`.

## Training
`supervised_FCN/train_fcn.py`: runs training of FCN on a subset dataset from the UCR archive.

`supervised_FCN/configs/config.yaml`: is where you can set parameters and hyper-parameters for dataset loading and training. 

# Training History
The training histories of FCN on all the UCR subset datasets are available [here](https://wandb.ai/daesoolee/supervised-FCN?workspace=user-daesoolee).

A training and test dataset split is the same as provided in the UCR archive, and a test dataset is used as a validation set during training for better training progress tracking.

# Optimizer
- initial learning rate: 1e-3
- learning rate scheduler: cosine learning rate scheduler
- optimizer: AdamW
- weight decay: 1e-5
- max epochs: 1000
- batch size: 256

# Example Templates
`supervised_FCN/example_data_loading.py`: a template for loading a subset dataset from the UCR archive.

`supervised_FCN/example_pretrained_model_loading.py`: a template for loading a pretrained FCN.

`supervised_FCN/example_compute_FID.py`: an example of computing the FID score.

`supervised_FCN/example_compute_IS.py`: an example of computing the IS (Inception Score).
