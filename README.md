# Description
Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) was proposed in a paper [1]. FCN's architecture is shown in the figure below. \
![Architecture of FCN](.imgs/fcn.png)

This repository offers a supervised-training code of FCN on all the subset datasets of the UCR archive. 
The trained FCN will be used to compute the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) score for evaluation of generated time series.

# Run
- `train_fcn.py`: runs training of FCN on a subset dataset from the UCR archive. 
- `configs/config.yaml`: is where you can set parameters and hyper-parameters for dataset loading and training. 

# Prerequisite
You need to download the UCR archive dataset and put it in `datasets/`. You can download it from [here](https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/daesool_ntnu_no/EUVHWAlJRrZBnCZMAOdTR-cB3m_LP7Q10Y78meuzUAuIBQ?e=h9aGhi).
Then, your `datasets` directory should have `datasets/UCRArchive_2018`.

# Training History
The training histories of FCN on all the UCR subset datasets are available [here](https://wandb.ai/daesoolee/supervised-FCN?workspace=user-daesoolee).

A training and test dataset split is the same as provided in the UCR archive, and a test dataset is used as a validation set during training for better training progress tracking.

# Optimizer
- initial learning rate: 1e-3
- learning rate scheduler: cosine learning rate scheduler
- optimizer: AdamW
- weight decay: 1e-5
- max epochs: 1000
- batch size: 256

# Example Templates
- `example_data_loading.py`: a template for loading a subset dataset from the UCR archive.
- `example_pretrained_model_loading.py`: a template for loading a pretrained FCN.
